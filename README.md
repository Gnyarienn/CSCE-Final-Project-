Background Information:

A generic 2-D vector field is defined as follows:

V(u,v) = u(x,y)i + v(x,y)j

In this equation u is the x velocity component of the field and v is the y component of the velocity field. As shown, both u and v are functions of x and y which represent the position of the vector field. An example of a 2-D velcity field is shown below:

V(u,v) = (3X^2+y^2)i + (5y+400x)j

Code Instructions:

1.In the first box at the bottom left of the user interface, enter the u component of the velocity field.
2.In the second box to the right of the first box, enter the v component of the velocity compoenent. 
3.The multiplication must be indicated with the usage of the '*' symbol. 
4.Note that the equations must be inserted using the variables 'x' and 'y' only.
5. Once the components are entered, click the 'plot' button and observe the graph.
6. Example of a valid input is shown within the two sets of brackets below:

V(u,v) = [3*y+2*x]i + [40 + x^2 + 3*y]j

Things to try out :

To visualize a rotational vector field, try :

V(u,v) = [y]i + [-x]j

To visualize a diverging vector field, try :

V(u,v) = [x]i + [y]j
